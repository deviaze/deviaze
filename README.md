# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m dev chrysalis (@deviaze)

## Blurb

I love writing code to ~~create &~~ solve interesting problems.

I'm a big fan of Rust (catching problems at compile time with great tooling and safety), programming language research & development, gamedev, and generally making software easier to use and more obvious to end users.

### Projects

Right now I'm working on:

- `seal`, a scripting-focused, cross-platform, highly-reliable, and lightweight Luau runtime with a focus on simplifying scripting & automation with inbuilt support for multithreading, key remapping (planned), and UI (planned).
- `Firefly`, a high-level programming language for expressionists who want to get things done, with great DX, expressive yet explicit error handling, compile-time safety, and both nominal and structural types. Inspired by Rust, Luau, Ruby, Python, Vlang, and others; in Firefly, types are first-class values and are the base data structure for everything else. Programming work will begin on Firefly once syntax and semantics are finalized.

### Professional work

As the primary software engineer on the FedEx InfoSec Data Science team @ UMRFV, I wrote, maintained, and automated infosec data science pipeline projects for FedEx's CIA team. I pushed our team to adopt modern Python tooling, including strict typechecking, better dependency management (uv), and polars > pandas for new projects--decisions that paid off with increased performance, reliability, maintainability, and ease-of-onboarding.
