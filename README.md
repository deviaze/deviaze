# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dev (@deviaze)

## Blurb
**Imperial Federation of Auraxis**
- I am the owner and primary developer of [Imperial Federation of Auraxis](https://www.roblox.com/groups/3115240), and my current projects include finishing the current CORE Midnight module for IFA, which will include all new UI, rescripted gun visuals and vfx, a new class and weapons system, and more. IFA's website is www.auraxis.co.

- I am a developer on roblox.com with at least 5 years experience in ROBLOX Studio and 1 year experience in 3D modeling using Blender. My primary focuses are programming (ROBLOX Lua), 3D modeling (hard surface, < 10,000 triangle count), and building. I also have experience with UI, and I use Photoshop 2021/2022 for graphic design and image editing.
